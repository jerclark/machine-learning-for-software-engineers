* If matrix is square, then:
AA^-1 = A^-1A = I

* Don't have an inverse? "Singular" or "Degenerate"

# Matrix Transpose
* Transpose A and B
* Take first row of A and create first column of B
* Repeat with each row to create new columns
* If A is m x n, then b will be n x m. Also B(ij) will equal A(ji)
