## Episode 10 - Langauges and Frameworks

* R, Matlab for math, stats
* Java + Hadoop / Scala + Spark - JVM based
* Python
    * Numpy for matlab-like math stuff
    * Pandas for data frames and stats
    * Tensorflow - can do almost all, but has DNN and lots of machine learning stuff.
        * Uses C/C++ under the hood (via symbolic graph) and processes the math on the GPU
* GPUs are good for matrix math (linear algebra)
