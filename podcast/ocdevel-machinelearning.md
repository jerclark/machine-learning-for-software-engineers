## Episode 10 - Langauges and Frameworks

* R, Matlab for math, stats
* Java + Hadoop / Scala + Spark - JVM based
* Python
    * Numpy for matlab-like math stuff
    * Pandas for data frames and stats
    * Tensorflow - can do almost all, but has DNN and lots of machine learning stuff.
        * Uses C/C++ under the hood (via symbolic graph) and processes the math on the GPU
* GPUs are good for matrix math (linear algebra)


## Episode 11 - Shallow Algos

* KNN - k nearest neighbors. Supervised. Plot all of the data, for the next sample, grab 
the nearest neighbor of each class and use the closest one.

* KMeans - Unsupervised. Will cluster samples by using "means" to determine which clusters
make the most sense.
