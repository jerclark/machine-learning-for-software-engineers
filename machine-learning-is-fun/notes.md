## 1 - machine learning is fun.
Read machine learning is fun. It was nice that many of the concepts were review or at least familiar. There's a good visualization of what the error function looks like for linear regression, and how taking the derivative of a sample on the error function will determine which way to "go down the bowl" - i.e. gradient descent.


## 2 - Super mario maker levels
* Incredible example of the 'ernest hemmingway' bot author
* Really helpful to see how determining the 'style' of earnest hemmingway would translate to determining the 'style' of super mario levels.
* Never really thought to pull 'level' data from the memory of an old cartridge. 
* Interesting to think about mapping each 'square to a character'
* Nice visualizations of to think of each vertical column in the level graphic as a sample. Then using a neural network
